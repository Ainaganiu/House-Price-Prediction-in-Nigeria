# House-Price-Prediction-in-Nigeria
The objective of this hackathon is to create a powerful and accurate predictive model that can estimate the prices of houses in Nigeria.

#DSN and Microsoft Skills for Job Hackathon
The objective of the challenge is to predict the price (Amount (Million Naira) the company should sell a house based on the available data

ID
Location
Amount (Million Naira)
-Bathroom

Bedroom
Parking space
The objective is to predict the price.

This dataset, consisting of 14,000 rows and 7 columns, reveals that the number of bathrooms and bedrooms significantly influences the price of a house, while the parking space has a minor influence unless it accommodates 5 or 6 vehicles.

**Summary**

A right-skewed histogram of housing prices indicates that the majority of houses are priced towards the lower end, with a long tail on the right side representing a smaller number of higher-priced properties.

Most customers purchase houses with 1 to 4 bedrooms, which aligns with the mean value of 4.3 and a standard deviation of 2.4. Similarly, houses with 1 to 3 bathrooms are most commonly purchased, aligning with a mean value of 3.1 and a standard deviation of 1.9.

Regarding parking space, houses with 3 to 4 spaces are most popular among customers, which aligns with the mean value of 3.2 and a standard deviation of 1.5.

Such patterns are common in real estate markets, where the majority of properties fall within a certain price range, while a smaller number of high-end properties contribute to the right tail of the distribution.

This project further used machine learning  to predict house prices using Python Programming Language.
